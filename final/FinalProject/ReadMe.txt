This is my Vocaob practice code. There are threee activities to practice vocabulary, falshcards, matching, and hangman.
Each Activity gives you points. The points can be used to buy items, either weapons or armor. There are 9 items total to be bought.
The main menu has 9 options, you can veiw the vocab word with their deffinitions, veiw an explination of each activity, do an activity,
buy items from the store, veiw inventory, change the vocab words, save progress, laod a file, and quit the program.
Through the veiw inventory option you can change your characters name, vewi your bought items, and equip items. 
Items cannot be bought more than once, so you can try to collect all of them. 
Progress can be saved to text files and loaded from text file like we did in prevous codes.
